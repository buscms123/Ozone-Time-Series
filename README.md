# Ozone-Time-Series


Client: A local Medical Facility

Data information and requirements:
Date ranges: Jan 1 2014 to May 31 2020
Test set : May 18-May 31st
Validation set : April 20th-May 17
Total # of observations:
Number minus leap days:
Things to keep in mind
Pollution variables have different units
Parts per billion are 1-hour maximum measurements (SO and NO)
Parts per million measurements are 8-hour max measurements (CO and Ozone)
The WT01 Fog variable mentioned in proposal is not actually in the data set


Objectives:
Accurately predict Daily Max 8-hour Ozone Concentration at Millbrook School station
Explore and provide information on the following potential models
ARIMA
ARIMAX
UCM
Ensemble
For each model provide the following:
MAPE and MAE (or some other measure of accuracy)
Potential gains
Potential challenges or drawbacks
Make a recommendation for which model the client should use
Provide graphics of the best model(s) forecast for test data overlaid with observed/actual values for test data
